# Restaurant2Recipe Recommender

Everyone's been there-- it's time to make dinner and you have no idea what you want. Recipe Recommender was built to help the next time you find yourself in this exact situation.

Recipe Recommender is a content-based recommendation system that uses the menu of a favorite SF restaurant to suggest recipes you might like. Recommendations are generated by first analyzing the text of the restaurant menus and recipe ingredient lists. The tool then determines the most similar recipes from the Restaurant2Recipe database, and returns results including pictures and links to the original recipes.

### Process
I first collected menu data from restaurants across San Francisco as well as recipe information from across the web. The recipe ingredient lists became the corpus for the recommender system, while the restaurant menu items and descriptions are stored and analyzed on an ad-hoc basis. This will allow me to extend the search utility in the future to include taking in new menus not already in my database.

The first step in almost any natural language processing (NLP) task is to translate your text into a numerical form, a process known as word embedding. I initially intended to use word2vec as a word embedding technique. I tested the system using both pretrained word2vec word vectors and tf-idf (term frequency-inverse document frequency) as word embedding techniques. Ultimately, I found better and more stable results in this instance using Tfidf.  

Once the text data has been vectorized, I next calculate cosine similarity for the queried restaurant against all recipe document vectors. I return the top most similar recipes.

### Evaluation

### Technology
Restaurant2Recipe was created in Python, and uses the following libraries:
<ul><li>gensim</li><li>nltk</li><li>BeautifulSoup</li><li>requests</li><li>pandas</li><li>numpy</li>
</ul>

The web app uses the Flask framework and is supported by a mongoDB database, hosted on an AWS EC2 instance.

### Credits
Restaurant2Recipe is powered by the Food2Fork recipe API and menu data from Yelp.
This project was completed to fulfill the capstone requirement for Galvanize Data Science Immersive in April 2016.
