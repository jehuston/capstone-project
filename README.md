Capstone project for Galvanize Data Science Immersive

Everyone's been there-- it's time to make dinner and you have no idea what you want. I built Recipe Recommender to help the next time I found myself in this situation.
Based on a favorite SF restaurant menu, I make suggestions of recipes you might like. Recommendations are generated by analyzing the text of the restaurants and recipes and 
using cosine similiarity to compute the most similar recipes.
